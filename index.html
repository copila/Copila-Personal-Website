			<h1>Personal Interests</h1>
			<h4 id="cooking_header"> Cooking & Food</h4>
			<p id= "cooking_drop"> 
			I am part Italian, and growing up my family bonded around food. Each meal was spent together, and prepping and cooking each meal was an opportunity to try something new, or to learn a classic dish that was a part of my ancestor's culture. Cooking has thus always been a natural passion of mine because of the creative outlet it provides, and the way it brings people together. </p>

			<h4 id="people_header"> People, Family, & Friends </h4>
			<p id= "people_drop"> People have always been a central component of my life. It is all of the amazing people in my life, that give me the strength and the desire to make the most of each day. Besides the support and enjoyment that people provide my life, I am also fascinated by people and what drives them. This led me to study psychology as an undergrad</p>

			<h4 id="tech_header"> Technology </h4>
			<p id="tech_drop"> Not until I started working, was I truly exposed to technology, and all of its power. Many people fail to realize this, but technology can be an incredibly creative outlet. I love technology because of its potential to enhance the lives of those around me. I get an incredible satisfaction from seeing something I wrote on a computer screen come to life. The fusion of how we best design technology for people is the crossroads between my interest in people and technology. </p>

			<h4 id="sports_header"> Sports </h4>
			<p id="sports_drop"> I grew up playing all kinds of sports my entire life. I love playing sports for the enjoyment of the game, the tactics involved, the team cameraderie, the endorphins from being active, and the competitive spirit of the game. </p>

			<h4 id="fitness_header"> Fitness & Nutrition </h4>
			<p id="fitness_drop"> Because I had such an active childhood, I love the rush and endoprhins that come with exercising. It helps me have more energy, think more clearly, be happier, and be healthier. I also am very cognizant of what I put into my body because I feel better  when I eat cleanly. I have fun experimenting with traditional recipes and how you can make them healthier without compromising taste. </p>

			<h4 id="outdoors_header"> The Outdoors </h4>
			<p id="outdoors_drop"> As part of being active, I love and crave the outdoors. Being outside in nature and the sunshine revitalizes me and makes me happy. It is where I get some of my best thinking and reflecting done. </p>

			<h4 id= "traveling_header"> Traveling </h4>
			<p id= "traveling_drop"> I am fascinated by cultures and I love traveling to far off places to experience and learn about different cultures. Learning about other places and ways of lifes helps me keep an open mind, and think about my own life differently. The world offers so much beauty, and it revitalizes me to see the different ways this beauty can exist and manifest itself. </p>

			<h4 id="photo_header"> Photography </h4>
			<p id="photo_drop"> To capture the beatufiul, raw, and deep moments in life I love taking pictures. There is something about the way a picture captures the emotion felt by the subject or the photographer that really resonates with me. It is one of the easiest ways to communicate and inspire others. </p>

			<h1>Work Experience</h1>
			<p> I spent the last four years of my career at S&P Capital IQ, a financial technology company that provides financial market information and analytics to various professionals in the financial community. While there, I held a couple of different roles.</p>
			<p> I first started out in sales, as a Client Development Associate, managing a book of clients. In this role, I learned how to effectively communicate with, interact with, and present to clients in various positions.</p>
			<p> Later, I worked as an Associate Produt Manager on our Real-Time product, which provides streaming stock market data in a light web based format. In this position, I was involved with all of the tasks and responsibilities associated with product management. It is my experience on the Real-Time team that inspired me to delve more deeply into technology, and to studying Information Systems at Cornell Tech</p>

			<h1>Academics</h1>
			<h2> Boston College</h2>
			<p>At Boston College, I majored in psychology, a natural choice given my passions above. I am fascinated by what makes people tick, how they learn, how they act in certain situations, and how they process information. While I loved studying psychology, I did not want to become a psychologist. </p>
			<h2> Cornell Tech</h2>
			<p> After my experience at S&P Capital IQ and Boston College, I decided that Cornell Tech's Information Systems, Connective Media masters program was an ideal fusion of two of my passions: psychology and technology. Connective Media has many definitions, but essentially is the way that people can connect with one another using technology. At Cornell Tech, we study both people and technology, and how we can best build technology for people to use and connect with one another.
