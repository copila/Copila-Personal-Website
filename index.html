				<h2>Work Experience</h2>

				 <p class = "section-header-blurb">I bring 6 years of product experience in various industries. I am driven by a desire to solve interesting problems, to make an impact in the world around me, and to continue to learn and grow. My career reflects these drivers. With a strong background in psychology, I am highly empathic and have good intuition for user psychology and needs. I have complemented this strength by investing in technical experience. </p>

				 <h3> Valimail - Product Manager </h3>
				<p>At Valimail, I was drawn to the mission of preventing phishing attacks and business email compromise. Here, I own our Domain intelligence platform which powers our anti-phishing products, Enforce and Defend, and generates leads through public tools. </p>

				<h3> Prudential Financial - Senior Digital Product Manager </h3>
				<p>At Prudential, in pursuit of helping individuals lead financially healthier lives I launched the solution center of our digital financial planning platform, LINK, for Prudential’s 30M+ customers, producing sales of $1M. The solution center helps users understand their progress towards their financial goals and recommends solutions to help them achieve these goals.  </p>
				<p> While in graduate school, I also interned at Prudential, helping to build the foundation for the digital financial planning platform-- a Unified Customer Dashboard. The UCD, now live, is a place for users to engage with all of their Prudential products in one place. </p>


				<h3> S&P Capital IQ </h3>
				<p>Prior to Prudential, I spent four years of my career at S&P Capital IQ, a financial technology company that provides financial market information and analytics to various professionals in the financial community. While there, I held a couple of different roles.</p>
				<h4> Associate Product Manager </h4>
				<p> As an Associate Product Manager on the Real-Time team, I worked very closely with our customers. Positioned as a customer expert, I had a clear understanding of business drivers and needs when defining product requirements for our next generation application.</p>
				<h4> Client Development Associate</h4>
				<p> I first started out in sales, as a Client Development Associate, growing a book of business. Through this position, I developed the skillset to unpack customer needs in order to offer them the appropriate solution. </p>

			<h2>Academia</h2>
			<h3> Cornell Tech</h3>
			<p> Cornell Tech's Information Systems, Connective Media masters program was an ideal fusion of two of my passions: psychology and technology. We studied both people and technology, and how we can best build technology for people to use and connect with one another. This program was very applied, so through startup projects, we built technology that used the theoretical concepts we learned. The projects below illustrate these principles. 
			</p>
			<h3> Projects</h3>
			<h4> Keymochi </h4>
			<p> Keymochi is an iOS application that can detect emotion based on keystroke pattern. The keyboard can be used universally across all applications to capture a hollistic view of a person's mood.  We extract the key features out of the data (speed of typing, distance between keys, punctuation use, rudimentary sentiment analysis, gyration, and acceleration), and discard the actual content. We then use machine learning to detect emotion.  </p>

			</div>
			<h4>Slamble </h4>
			<p> This application sought to improve sleeping habits by creating a game with friends. The web component used  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Backbone.js, EJS, and Parse for the backend. The iOS application used Objective C for the frontend, JavaScript for middleware and APIs, and Parse for the backend. </p>

			<h4> Flow </h4>
			<p> Flow is an application that enables knowledge workers to maintain focus and improve productivity. With our Mac and iPhone application “Flow,” users in a state of concentration receive their notifications (text, email, Slack) in the form of occasional digests. The iPhone application is visibly propped up, showing colleagues that the user does not want to be disturbed. For users not “in flow,” they are able to see statuses of other team members so they know who is currently unavailable to chat. This workflow carves out the space and time for knowledge workers to truly be productive, while still staying engaged in the workplace.</p>

			<h3> Boston College</h3>
			<p>For undergrad, I studied psychology At Boston College. I am fascinated by what makes people tick, how they learn, how they act in certain situations, and how they process information. This passion has been a constant thread in my work and studies. </p>

			<h2> Personal Interests</h2>
			<h4 class = "hover_header" id="cooking_header"> Cooking & Food</h4>
			<p id= "cooking_drop"> 
			I am part Italian, and growing up my family bonded around food. Preparing and eating each meal was an opportunity to spend time together. Cooking has thus always been a natural passion of mine because of the creative outlet it provides, and the way it brings people together. </p>

			<h4 class = "hover_header" id="people_header"> People, Family, & Friends </h4>
			<p id= "people_drop"> People have always been a central component of my life. It is all of the amazing people in my life, that give me the strength and the desire to make the most of each day. Besides the support and enjoyment that people provide my life, I am also fascinated by people and what drives them. This led me to study psychology as an undergrad</p>

			<h4 class = "hover_header" id="tech_header"> Technology </h4>
			<p id="tech_drop"> Not until I started working, was I truly exposed to technology, and all of its power. Many people fail to realize this, but technology can be an incredibly creative outlet. I love technology because of its potential to enhance the lives of those around me. I get an incredible satisfaction from seeing something I wrote on a computer screen come to life. The fusion of how we best design technology for people is the crossroads between my interest in people and technology. </p>

			<h4 class = "hover_header" id="sports_header"> Sports </h4>
			<p id="sports_drop"> I grew up playing all kinds of sports my entire life. I love playing sports for the enjoyment of the game, the tactics involved, the team cameraderie, the endorphins from being active, and the competitive spirit of the game. </p>

			<h4  class = "hover_header" id="fitness_header"> Fitness & Nutrition </h4>
			<p id="fitness_drop"> Because I had such an active childhood, I love the rush and endoprhins that come with exercising. It helps me have more energy, think more clearly, be happier, and be healthier. I also am very cognizant of what I put into my body because I feel better  when I eat cleanly. I have fun experimenting with traditional recipes and how you can make them healthier without compromising taste. </p>

			<h4 class = "hover_header" id="outdoors_header"> The Outdoors </h4>
			<p id="outdoors_drop"> As part of being active, I love and crave the outdoors. Being outside in nature and the sunshine revitalizes me. It is where I get some of my best thinking and reflecting done. </p>

			<h4 class = "hover_header" id= "traveling_header"> Traveling </h4>
			<p id= "traveling_drop"> I love traveling to far off places to experience and learn about different cultures. Seeing other places and ways of life helps me keep an open mind, and think about my own life differently. I am revitalized by seeing different ways the world's beauty manifestz itself. </p>

			<h4 class = "hover_header" id="photo_header"> Photography </h4>
			<p id="photo_drop"> To capture the beatufiul, raw, and deep moments in life I love taking pictures. There is something about the way a picture captures the emotion felt by the subject or the photographer that really resonates with me. It is one of the easiest ways to communicate and inspire others. </p>
